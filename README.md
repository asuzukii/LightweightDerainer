# LightweightDerainer

This is a capstone project for ECE 113D at UCLA, done by Akira Suzuki and John Paul Dillard. 

The lightweight derainer takes singleshot photos with adverse rain effects such as rain accumulation and streaks.
These are then put through a model based on the U-net and ouputs a derained model, with reduced effects of rain.

If you are using this for inspiration for your next project and want to run a couple of files, you'll need to
receive the sample dataset from us. Contact us at asuzuki100@ucla.edu.
